This LaTeX package provides signed and numbered marginal comments.

Get the latest version at 
https://github.com/Etn40ff/say

USAGE:

This package, called without options, adhere to the global draft/final LaTeX
options i.e. unless draft is passed to \documentclass it does nothing.

To override the global behaviour just pass manually the option draft or final
that you want. For example
\usepackage[draft]{say}
will force the notes to appear.

The extra option hidenumbers can be used avoid printing numbers in the text
\usepackage[draft,hidenumbers]{say}

To make a comment the command is
\say[Your name goes here]{Your comment goes here.}
for convenience it might be better to define aliases like this one
\newcommand{\saySS}[1]{\say[SS]{#1}}

If you use the geometry package to change the width of your page you might
have to specify also marginparwidth to avoid your notes going out of the
page. For example:
\usepackage[margin=1in, marginparwidth=0.8in]{geometry}
