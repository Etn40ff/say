USAGE:

This package, called without options, adhere to the global draft/final LaTeX
options i.e. unless draft is passed to \documentclass it does nothing.

To override the global behaviour just pass manually the option draft or final
that you want. For example
\usepackage[draft]{say}
will force the notes to appear.

The extra option hidenumbers can be used avoid printing numbers in the text
\usepackage[draft,hidenumbers]{say}

To make a comment the command is
\say[Your name goes here]{Your comment goes here.}
for convenience it might be better to define aliases like this one
\newcommand{\saySS}[1]{\say[SS]{#1}}
